## Welcome to the Achordeon project!

Achordeon is basically a chord editor, organizer and notation tool.

It was designed to replace [Chordii](http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/).

Many song writers use text editor to do the writing, and this works quite well.
But sometimes you have to change words or insert lines, and therefore you have to reformat all your chords. This can be pretty much work. This is where Achordeon steps in.

Achordeon lets you enter chords and text in the same place, and creates nice looking PDF song sheets from your input.
This means:
- all chords names appear right above the right lyrics
- the lyrics will always be in the font and size of your choice
- the chords used in a song can be printed as grids at the bottom of the page.

### Lets see an example
`
{title:Auld Lang Syne}
{st:Traditional}

{c:4/4}
Should old a[C]cquaintance be forgot  [G7]  
And neve[C]r brought to mind [F] 
Should old acq[C]uaintanc[Am]e be forgot [G7]  
And days[F] of auld lang syne [C]  [F] 

{soc}
For aul[C]d lang syne, my[G7] dear,
For aul[C]d lang syne,    [F] 
We'll take[C] a cup o'k[Am]indness[G7] yet
And days[F] of auld lang syne [C]  [F]
{eoc}

And there''s a hand, my trusty fiere,
And gie''s a hand o'' thine!
And we''ll tak a right guid-willie waught
For auld lang syne.

{c:Chorus}
